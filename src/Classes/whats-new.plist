	<string>.11.4 (September 2020)</string>
	<string>$RailMap Updated MAX map to September 2020 version (three stops were closed).</string>
	<string>$Detours #O#bNew look for Alerts#b
Alerts now include links inline in the text, such as trimet.org or Stop ID #Lid:7586 7586#T. Alerts are now consistently sorted, and additional links are at the end like this: #Lhttps:/trimet.org/health/ More#T
#Lroute:100 See route info#T
#A(Effective as of now)</string>
	<string>$Settings Fixed issue with reading TriMet&apos;s route file, so the optional fetching of route lines for maps will work again, now it fetches in the background too.  This is a cool feature - turn it on in the settings.  For #bShow Route Paths on Maps#b, choose #b#B&quot;Fetch in background, Monthly&quot;#0#b.</string>
	<string>Fixed a issue where, on the details screen, vehicles may be shown as due after they had left.</string>
	<string>Code has been tidied up a lot internally to make it easier to maintain, as I had time on my hands.  :-(</string>
	<string>+https://github.com/teleportaloo/PDX-Bus/blob/master/Shortcuts.markdown#introduction Added support for Shortcuts app to get arrivals, stop locations, and routes. See documentation, and try the Shortcuts app.</string>
	<string>$CheckNetwork Improved check network screen to show progress.</string>
	<string>Trip planner results now include the number of transfers.</string>
	<string>Various #iother#i bug fixes üêú.</string>
	<string>Updated some station names as the South Waterfront area has changed from &quot;SW Portland&quot; to &quot;S Portland&quot;. The Streetcar map and stations are not yet changed.</string>
	<string>Updated map sharing to allow sharing of a map link for a stop.</string>
	<string>Note: This will be the last update for iOS 10, as Apple makes it hard to test older than the last three versions.</string>
	<string>.11.3.1 (January 2020)</string>
	<string>Small fix for maps if they are on the screen when the mode changes from dark to light or vice versa.</string>
	<string>Fix for the pull-down search in iOS 13, sometimes items at the bottom of the page were hidden behind the keyboard.</string>
	<string>Fixed the date picker screen in the trip planner - the date picker is now aligned properly.</string>
	<string>Added information for new 2019 vehicles.</string>
	<string>Completed changing the descriptions of the times from #iArrivals#i to #iDepartures#i.  The times have always been #ideparture#i times,  even though the internal documentation often calls them #iarrival#i times.  It is clearer if we refer to them as departure times.</string>
	<string>Re-worked departure and proximity alarms, improved user interface and improved accuracy.</string>
	<string>Several other small bug fixes and tweaks, including more information when a vehicle goes off route.</string>
	<string>.11.3 (September 2019)</string>
	<string>Support for iOS 13 dark mode,  including new icons, reversed colors, changing mode on the fly.</string>
	<string>$TripPlanner Trip Planner now looks up addresses and landmarks using Apple&apos;s geolocating services (instead of TriMet).   This gives more accurate and up-to-date searches with full addresses.</string>
	<string>$TripPlanner Trip Planner user-interface for inputing addresses has been enlarged and re-designed.</string>
	<string>$RailMap Updated TriMet MAX map to use the September 2019 version, which highlights that some stops are closing in 2020.</string>
	<string>Small fix in the color picker, used for tagging vehicles.</string>
	<string>Minor bug fixes including: fixed issue with creating a bookmark when there is a system wide alert.</string>

	<string>PDX Bus can now use iCloud to share bookmarks between devices, and to restore bookmarks when the app is deleted and reinstalled.</string>
	<string>User interface tweaks.</string>
	<string>Added information about the latest new electric busses.</string>
	<string>Various bug fixes.</string>
	<string>Watch:  System Wide alert text will hide when touched.</string>
	<string>.11.1 (January 2019)</string>
	<string>iOS 12 Siri Shortcuts:  Use the &quot;Add this stop to Siri&quot; menu item to associate a stop with a phrase for Siri, and Siri will say and show all the arrivals for a single stop.</string>
	<string>iOS 12 Siri Shortcuts:  Use the  &quot;Add to Siri to launch with bookmark&quot; menu item to associate a bookmark with a phrase for Siri, who will launch PDX Bus and show the bookmark. Siri won&apos;t attempt to read all the arrivals in this case, as there could be a lot as each bookmark can have many stops.</string>
	<string>iOS 12 Siri Shortcuts:  Use the &quot;Add to Siri&quot; menu item on the locate screen to set up a phrase to launch the app and locate nearby arrivals, routes or show a map.</string>
	<string>WatchOS 5 Siri Shortcuts: Support for some Siri shortcuts on the watch app (trip planning is not supported from the watch).</string>
	<string>WatchOS:  Added complications support to launch watch app from a watch face.</string>
	<string>iOS: Detours are shown for stops without arrivals.</string>
	<string>All: : Bug fixes;  modernized memory management. I found a place that can cause a hang;  this was probably the real cause of the issue when getting routes.</string>
	<string>iOS: Fonts.  Now displays the time in larger text when the arrival time is more than an hour away.   Uses Verdana where there are changing numbers - this looks better as the numbers are fixed width. Fixed text alignment issues.</string>
	<string>All: Now displays the day of the week if arrival time is more than 12 hours away, instead of the date.</string>
	<string>.11.0.3 (October 2018)</string>
	<string>Modified route indexing to hopefully stop occasional hang.</string>
	<string>.11.0.2 (October 2018)</string>
	<string>I&apos;ve been looking into the way it hangs for some people, especially when getting routes, and hopefully I have a fix.  Thanks for all the bug reports and pictures, it really helps!</string>
	<string>.11.0.1 (October 2018)</string>
	<string>Fixed issue where app will not launch on iOS8 and 9.</string>
	<string>Fixed issue with Refresh not working on Lookup stop by Route.</string>
	<string>.11.0 (September 2018)</string>
	<string>Updated for iOS 12.  Added basic support for Siri Shortcuts.</string>
	<string>Updated to use new #b#BTriMet#D#b data - may include more details about delays, vehicle IDs, vehicle types and when busses are full.</string>
	<string>Improved speed of arrival downloads by combining queries.</string>
	<string>$Detours Updated detours to use new #b#BTriMet#D#b alert data - including #+#bsystem wide alerts#-#b. #(#AThey also show the start and end time#)#D. Removed &quot;Rider Alerts&quot; as it was basically the same as the detour list and renamed the detours to be &quot;Detours, delays and closures&quot;.   Detours also include messages about the streetcar.</string>
	<string>$Settings You can adjust how many departures are shown. In the settings there is a new setting &quot;Don&apos;t show route after arrival &gt; N mins away&quot;.  Arrivals for each route served at each stop will be shown up to the first that is further than the chosen number of minutes away. </string>
	<string>$Tweet Updated Twitter links, as #b#BTriMet#D#b now has three Twitter accounts. Touch here to see.</string>
	<string>Late color is now #M#bmagenta#b#D, as #isome people#i thought #N#bbrown#b#D was a bit close to #A#bgrey#b#D.</string>
	<string>VoiceOver text for detours improved to pronounce local #b#BTriMet#0#b words better (eg 185th Ave TC MAX Stn).  #i##test#b!</string>
	<string>Added search to detours, recent stops, recent trips and this #iWhat&apos;s New#i screen (pull down for search box).</string>
	<string>$Settings Maps:  There is a new option to show the route paths on the maps.  These paths are useful, but they are a 10 MB download so this is off by default.</string>
	<string>Watch:  Improved commuter bookmark user-interface - it will show when it is active in the title.</string>
	<string>Watch:  When locating stops, it will show you the routes and directions served by each stop.</string>
	<string>Watch:  Added a swipe left to move to the next stop, and improved speed and stability.</string>
