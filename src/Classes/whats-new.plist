	<string>iOS: Fonts.  Now displays the time in larger text when the arrival time is more than an hour away.   Uses Verdana where there are changing numbers - this looks better as the numbers are fixed width. Fixed text alignment issues.</string>

	<string>Fixed issue where app will not launch on iOS8 and 9.</string>
